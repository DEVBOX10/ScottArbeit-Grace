## Welcome to Grace.

Grace is a **new**, **modern**, **cloud-native** **version control system**.

Grace is **easy to use**, **easy to understand**, and **consistently fast**. And it's **powerful**, ready to handle large repositories and large file sizes.

Grace can run in the background, making it **ambient**, **faster**, and **more valuable to your everyday work** as a developer.

Grace **connects you with others** working in your repository, **across the globe**, **in real-time**, enabling **new experiences** and **new ways of sharing**.

to be clear:
> Grace is **new** üßëüèº‚Äçüî¨ and **alpha-level** right now. üî•üßØ It is deeply incomplete. Grace is not currently meant to be relied on or used for anything other than its own development and testing (including playing with it to give feedback, of course).[^git]

## Vision

A lot of this remains to be built, but here's what I expect V1 to look like.

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### Simple CLI
Grace is explicitly designed to be easy to use, and easy to understand. And fast.

The CLI reflects that. There's a simple-to-understand grammar, built-in aliases for common gestures, and common-sense defaults.

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### grace watch
Grace includes a file system watcher - `grace watch` - that both watches your working directory for changes, and keeps a live connection to Grace Server, connecting you in real-time to your team around the world.

`grace watch` takes action for you, whether that's uploading and downloading new file versions, processing notifications from other repo users, or running custom actions that you create.

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### Commits... and saves, checkpoints, and merges
In Git, `commit` is an overloaded concept. It can mean:
- "I'm partially done" - doing a local commit after each unit of work
- "I'm really done" - this one is for the pull request
- Even merges get called `commits`.

And then you get the "squash" vs. "don't squash" debate. Sigh.

Grace simplifies this by making a clear distinction:
- `grace checkpoint` - this means "I'm partially done"
- `grace commit` - this means "this one is a candidate for a merge" - i.e. pull request
- `grace merge` - this is, well, a pointer to a merge
- `grace save` - this is used by `grace watch` for saving versions of files between checkpoints, because...

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### Every save uploaded
By default, `grace watch` uploads new file versions (and new directory versions with recomputed SHA-256 hashes) after every save-on-disk. This lets Grace give you two very cool things:
- very fast `grace checkpoint` and `commit` and `merge`, and,
- a **Version History view** that will let you to flip through your versions, helping you remember what you were thinking, and enabling easy, instant restore of some or all of your changes.

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### Live, two-way client-server communication
When running `grace watch`, Grace uses [SignalR](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/signalr) to create a live, two-way communication channel between client and server. 

This connection allows Grace to do everything it does to connect you to everyone else working in your repository in real-time. Events happening across the repository can trigger actions both locally and on the server.

And it lets you share your code with team members faster than ever.

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### Shift left on merge conflicts
Merge conflicts suck. Finding out that you have one, when you thought you were already done with your work, is one of the most anxiety-inducing parts of coding. Grace tries to eliminate them by helping you keep your branch up-to-date.

When your parent branch gets updated, by default, `grace watch` will auto-rebase your branch on those changes, so you're always coding against the latest version that you'll have to merge with.

95% of the time, when you rebase, nothing bad happens. The other 5% lets you find out right away, fix it while you're in flow, and skip the merge conflict.

Grace can't promise to eliminate all merge conflicts, but it can help to reduce them.

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### Simplified branching strategy
Grace's default branching strategy is called *single-step* and is designed to help reduce merge conflicts, and to make it easier to work on and promote code to shipping branches (like `main`).

While Grace will need to support other, more complex branching strategies, single-step should be all that you need to run most projects.

There's a [separate page](docs/Branching%20strategy.md) that describes it in detail.

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### Handle large repositories
Got a lot of files? a lot of users? a lot of versions?

In short... Got a monorepo?

No problem, Grace is ready for it. So far, Grace has been tested on repositories as large as 100,000 files with 15,000 directories, with excellent performance (if you're running `grace watch`).

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### Handle large files
Because Grace is centralized, there's no problem storing large files. Really large files. It's been tested with 10GB files, and it should handle even larger files well.

Grace will let you specify how to handle those files, like only downloading them for the Design department, but not for the programmers or for the DevOps build. It's up to you.

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### Native GUI
Yeah, I said it.

Grace will have a native GUI app for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS. (And eventually Linux.[^mauilinux])

Take Grace with you wherever you go. Merge conflict UI, Version History view, repository browsing, current status and more... all running at full native speed on your devices.

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### Web UI
And Grace will ship with a default web UI. Sometimes the best way to share information is using a URL.

CLI + Web UI + GUI... use Grace the way you want to.

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### ACL's, down to the file level
Grace goes way beyond just repository-level permissions. Grace uses OpenID and OAuth2 to integrate with your AuthN and AuthZ providers. Want to lock down specific paths in your repository to specific users and groups? With Grace, you'll be able to.

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### No stashing
Because `grace watch` automatically uploads new file versions after every save, and commands like `grace switch` ensure that everything in your working directory is preserved before switching to another branch or reference, there's no need to stash anything. Just `switch` and go.

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### Branch-level control of reference types
Plan your branching strategy in greater detail than ever before. Grace lets you decide which kinds of references are enabled in each branch. 

For instance, `main` might enable merges and tags, and disable commits, checkpoints, and saves.

Ordinary user branches might disable merges, but enable everything else.

It's up to you.

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### Ephemeral checkpoints and saves.
Checkpoints and saves are features to help **you** be more productive, but we don't need to keep them forever. Grace allows you to control how long they're kept are kept in each repository. 72 hours? One week? A month? It's up to you.

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### Delete versions if you need to
Sometimes you need to delete a commit, whether it's because a secret was accidentally checked in, or because of some other security vulnerability. With the right permissions, you'll be able to remove bad versions of your code (with a permanent reference that says that you did).

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### Fast UX
Grace maximizes speed as a part of providing great UX. To save you time, Grace precomputes views and projections that you might want to see, like diffs and directory contents, ensuring that over 99% of requests for that data (P99) are served using precomputed projections. When this data is likely never to be needed again, it's deleted, saving storage space, and is regenerated automatically when requested.

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### Pre-rendered diffs
Every time you run `grace commit`, `grace merge`, or `grace checkpoint`, and every time `grace watch` uploads a new version of a file, Grace Server can optionally pre-render diffs for you to see, either in the CLI or in the Version History view. This makes seeing your ongoing changes in the Version History view instantaneous.

They're automatically aged out and deleted after a configurable length of time, so they don't waste resources.

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### A simple Web API
Grace Server is a modern Web API application. Like Grace's CLI, the Web API is easy to use, and easy to understand.

Grace ships with a .NET SDK, which is simply a projection of the Web API into .NET (and which Grace CLI uses). SDK's for other platforms are welcomed as community contributions.

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### SHA-256 hashes
Grace uses SHA-256 hashes to verify that the files that you save and commit are exactly the ones that get retrieved by clients. Grace will include a command to verify the SHA-256 hashes of all downloaded files.

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### Local file cache
Grace maintains a local file cache of versions of files that it's downloaded, and prunes it regularly. When running `grace watch`, Grace can download new file versions from multiple branches in the background so your `grace switch` commands run nearly instantly.

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### 2048 characters
`grace commit/checkpoint/save/merge/tag -m <some message>`... that message can be up to 2048 characters.

Feel free to share. The person you help might be future you.

### Import from Git / Export to Git
Yes, we know... it's hard to let go. Grace will perform an initial import from Git repo, and will export to a Git repo.[^gitexport]

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Green.svg)
### Operations (if you're thinking about hosting your own server)
Grace Server is a modern, cloud-native Web API application. It will ship in a container on Docker Hub. (Of course.)

Grace Server is designed to be easy to deploy and operate. It runs on your choice of dozens of cloud-native databases, components and services, using [Dapr](https://dapr.io), making it flexible and inherently scalable. Grace Server is stateless and scales up and down well using basic [KEDA](https://keda.sh/) counters.

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Orange.svg)
## Design and Motivations

If you'd like to read about some of the design thinking and motivations behind Grace - topics like UX, performance, scalability, monorepos, Git, and more - please read [Design and Motivations](docs/Design%20and%20Motivations.md).

![](https://gracevcsdevelopment.blob.core.windows.net/static/Orange.svg)
## Project structure

Grace is written primarily in [F#](), and is organized into nine .NET projects.

- **Grace.CLI** is the command-line interface for Grace.
- **Grace.Server** is an ASP.NET Core project that defines the Web API for Grace.
- **Grace.SDK** is a .NET class library that is a platform-specific projection of the Web API; it is used by Grace.CLI and wraps the HTTPS calls to Grace Server.
- **Grace.Actors** holds the code for the Actors in the system; it is used exclusively by Grace.Server.
- **Grace.Shared** is where all common code goes; it is used by all of the other **Grace.*** projects.
- *(future)* **Grace.MAUI** will contain a native GUI for Grace for Windows, Android, MacOS, and iOS (and hopefully Linux).
- *(future)* **Grace.Blazor** will be an ASP.NET Core project containing a web UI for Grace.
- **CosmosJsonSerializer** is a custom JSON serializer class, used when deploying Grace with Azure Cosmos DB.

An additional project, **Grace.Load**, is an experiment to create a load test for Grace.Server.

## Deployment
Grace Server will be shipped as a container, which will be made available on Docker Hub. Dapr's sidecar and actor placement processes are shipped as containers and are available on Docker Hub.

We intend to provide a Docker Compose template, as well as Kubernetes configuration for deployment, allowing for deployment to any major public cloud provider, as well as on-premises hardware.

[^grace]: Definition excerpted from https://www.thefreedictionary.com/grace.

[^git]: Grace currently uses Git for its source control, and runs Grace in the same directory as a means of testing. Officially self-hosting Grace's source code on Grace will, of course, happen when it's safe to.

[^mauilinux]: If the [.NET MAUI team adds support for Linux Desktop](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/discussions/339), which you should totally go give a thumbs-up to.

[^gitexport]: By default, Grace will export the latest state of each branch into a Git-formatted file. Exporting an entire Grace repository to Git can be an expensive operation, and is expected to be a rarely-used feature. Live two-way synchronization is not supported.
