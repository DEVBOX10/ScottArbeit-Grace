# Just list the patterns you want to ignore.

# Patterns for files do not have a path separator (i.e. no "/"), and use normal ? and * wildcards.
# Examples:
# *.exe
# *.obj

# Patterns containing a path separator ('/') allow for ignoring directories that contain the specified string.
# Examples:
# */bin/*
# */obj/*

*.exe
*.dll
*.obj
*.tmp
*.TMP
*.temp
*.pdb
*.cache
*.CopyComplete
*.???~
